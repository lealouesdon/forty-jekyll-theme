<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>Enigmarium was a school project in a team of 6.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal was to develop a solution to help secondary school students to learn maths and programming logic.</p>
<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>The format of the solution was free so we decided to create a software in JAVA. Our approch was to use an imersive story and games in order to wotk on the school subjects. In the header is a screenshot of a step in the story, the characters leading to games.</p>
