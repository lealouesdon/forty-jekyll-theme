<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>Enigmarium was a school project in a team of 6.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal was to develop a solution to help secondary school students to learn maths and programming logic.</p>
<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>The format of the solution was free so we decided to create a software in JAVA. Our approach was to use an immersive story and games in order to work on the school subjects. In the header is a screenshot of a step in the story, the characters leading to games. We used Swing for the user interface.</p>

<h3>My Contribution</h3>
<p>I was the main developer for this project. I designed the architecture of the project. I also help create the demos.</p>
