School project using GO and MQTT.
This project was in a grouo of 4, organized using Scrum.
The goal of this project was to create a Go app and for it to communicate with airport sensors. The sensors where simulated. This project allowed us to discover and work with GO as well as MQTT, to comunicate with the sensors.
We used a noSQL database (redis) to store the data.
An REST API the exposed the data to a web page made with GO templating.
