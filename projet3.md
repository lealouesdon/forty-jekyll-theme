<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>This was a school project in a group of 4, organized using Scrum.</p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to create a Go app and for it to communicate with airport sensors. The sensors where simulated. This project allowed us to discover and work with GO as well as MQTT, to communicate with the sensors.</p>

<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>This project was coded using Go, Redis and MQTT.We used a noSQL database (redis) to store the data.
An REST API the exposed the data to a web page made with GO templating.</p>

<h3>My Contribution</h3>
<p>I was Scum master in this project. I helped with the organization of the team. I was also developer, mainly for the FronEnd with Go templating.</p>
