<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>This was a school project in a group of 4, organized using Scrum. We used Travis CI and SonarCould to ensure the quality of our code.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to create an online multiplayer word game.</p>

<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>We used Angular, node.js, hosted on Firebase. <br>
The challenge of this project was dealing the different async calls made by the players, as well as analyzing all the data in order to render statistics. 
 <br> To manage async calls we used socket.io<p>
