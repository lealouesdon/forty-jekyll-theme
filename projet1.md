School project using Angular, node.js, hosted on Firebase.
This project was in a group of 4, organized using Scrum. We used Travis CI and SonarCould to ensure the quality of our code. <br>
The goal of this project was to create an online word game.
The challenge of this project was dealing the different async calls made by the players, as well as analyzing all the data in order to render statistics. <br> To manage async calls we used socket.io
<br>
The game is accessible here : <a href="https://jeu-de-mots.firebaseapp.com/">https://jeu-de-mots.firebaseapp.com/</a>.<br>
