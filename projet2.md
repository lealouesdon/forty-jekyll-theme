<h3>The context</h3>
<p>Steazzi is a personal project I am working on with 4 other people. It is currently available on the Play Store.</p>

<h3>The Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of the app is to help with statistics for handball. Handball is a sport that is currently lacking if effective and precise statistics for matches. We wish to make that accessible to everyone, no matter the size or importance of the team. In the header is a screenshot of our main screen, enabling the user to create statistics entries throughout the match.</p>

<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>The app is coded in Flutter, with an Api for the backend.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>The user creates teams and players in those teams.</p>
<p>On the day of the match, the user launches the app to enter stats. The stats are taken during the match. Below is an example of the type of stats the user can extract at the end of a match.</p>

<h3>And now?</h3>
<p>There is currently a first version on the play store. However, a second version in currently in development.</p>
<h3>My Contribution</h3>
<p>I am currently working on the second version. I contribute to the development of the app as well as the design.</p>
