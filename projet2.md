<h3>The context</h3>
<p>Steazzi is a personal project I am working on with 4 other people. It is currently available on the Play Store.</p>

<h3>The Goals</h3>
<p>The goal of the app is to help with statistics for handball. Handball is a sport that is currently lacking if effective and precise statistics for matches. We wish to make that accessible to everyone, no matter the size or importance of the team. In the header is a screenshot of our main screen, enabling the user to creat statistics entries throughout the match.</p>

<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>The app is coded in Flutter, with an Api for the backend.</p>
