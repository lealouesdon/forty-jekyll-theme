<h3>The Context</h3>
<p>Performance 400 is a work project, we developped in a team of 2.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal was to be able to track a runner and compute it's speed. This project was made in partnership with Agn√®s Raharolahy, a french runner.</p>
<h3>The Technologies</h3>
<p>In order to do that, we used Python and the OpenCV library for video analysis. This allowed us to detect mouvement in the video, go from 2D to 3D in order to compute the speed of the runner. We created an API using Flask in order to make all the functions accessible using an app. The app was coded using Flutter.
A part of the project was also setting up a Linux Server to host the API and communicate wit the GoPro cameras.</p>
