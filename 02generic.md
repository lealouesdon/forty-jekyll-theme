My name is LÃ©a and programming is my passion. Why? Because I love creating solution that can improve the life of others, and thinking without limits. <br>
Apart from programming I enjoy music, I play the piano in a band. As a sport, I play rugby and I love skiing. <br>
I also love to travel and discover the world. I have been to multiple countries and hope to continue to travel, for work or leisure.
